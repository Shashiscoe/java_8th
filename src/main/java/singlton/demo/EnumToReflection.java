/**
 * Overcome reflection issue: To overcome issue raised by reflection, enums are
 * used because java ensures internally that enum value is instantiated only
 * once. Since java Enums are globally accessible, they can be used for
 * singletons. Its only drawback is that it is not flexible i.e it does not
 * allow lazy initialization.
 * 
 * As enums don�t have any constructor so it is not possible for Reflection to
 * utilize it. Enums have their by-default constructor, we can�t invoke them by
 * ourself. JVM handles the creation and invocation of enum constructors
 * internally. As enums don�t give their constructor definition to the program,
 * it is not possible for us to access them by Reflection also. Hence,
 * reflection can�t break singleton property in case of enums.
